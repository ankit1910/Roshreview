<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<div class="section no-border">
  <p>This user agreement ("agreement") is a contract between you and Rosh Review, LLC, and applies to your subscription to and use of products and services available through <a href="http://www.roshreview.com">www.roshreview.com</a> (collectively the "services"). If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement, please do not use or access the services.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">User Agreement</p>
  <p>You must read, agree with, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this agreement before you become a subscriber to and user of Rosh Review’s services.</p>
  <p>We may amend this agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on our site  <a href="http://www.roshreview.com">www.roshreview.com</a> (the "site"). Except as stated below, all amended terms shall be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on our site. Upcoming changes will also be posted on this page.</p>
  <p>In this agreement, "you" or "your" means any person or entity subscribing to and/ or using the service ("users"). Unless otherwise stated, "Rosh Review," "we," or "our" will collectively refer to Rosh Review, LLC.</p>
  <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING USE, CONDITIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE SUBSCRIBING TO OUR MATERIAL. AGREEING TO THE TERMS OF USE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">License</p>
  <p>In consideration of and subject to your payment of the appropriate subscription fee for the services you subscribe to, and your agreement to and compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement, Rosh Review grants to you a non-exclusive, non-sub licensable, non-transferable license, and right to use and access the Rosh Review content (the "licensed materials") from multiple places/locations/computers at "different times." You are not allowed to access the Rosh Review content from multiple places/locations/computers at "same" time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">System Requirements</p>
  <p>You must use a Rosh Review recommended version of an operating system, Internet browser, and any other required software to access the licensed materials. Our system requirements are available for review.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">Software Use Terms</p>
  <p>The Rosh Review software used for the question banks (Qbank) (hereafter collectively referred to as "software") is designed to work with Java Runtime Engine (JRE) 1.5 or higher on Windows and 1.4 or higher on Macintosh. Any attempt to use the Rosh Review software with lower versions of JRE constitutes a violation of the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement, and might result in unexpected behavior, for which Rosh Review cannot be held responsible or liable for any damages. The Rosh Review software is designed to access your computer system's clipboard during use of the Rosh Review software. While a test is in progress, the Rosh Review software shall disable all clipboard functions of your computer system (including, but not limited to, copy-paste-print and save-to-disk functions). Furthermore, the Rosh Review software shall monitor all processes on your computer to determine if there exists any applications that could be used (intentionally or unintentionally) to copy contents. Simultaneous use of such applications (hereafter referred to as "dubious applications") with the Rosh Review software constitutes a violation of this agreement. Rosh Review reserves the right to determine which application classifies as a "dubious application". When such a process (or) application is found to be active on a user's machine, the administrator will be notified with the "dubious" process name and the user will also be notified with instructions to disable it on every attempt. In addition, Rosh Review reserves the right to disable the launch of any test(s), if any such "dubious application" is found to be active on the user’s computer system. The user will not be able to switch between applications when Rosh Review software is running. The user also understands and acknowledges this disabled function as part of the subscription terms.</p>
  <p>The user authorizes Rosh Review software to access the computer on which the self-assessment exam is being taken, and monitor every keyboard stroke for that computer. The user also agrees to only use a computer mouse when taking the self-assessment exam. In the event that more than three (3) keyboard strokes are detected, Rosh Review reserves the right to suspend the user’s subscription, report such unethical actions to medical committees and residency programs, and pursue legal action if necessary.</p>
  <p>The content presented in the self-assessment examination serves as an educational tool only for medical students and graduates. The Assessment Score is calculated by Rosh Review based on its own proprietary algorithm. This is not intended to predict your performance on the actual In-Service or Written Board Examination, but is designed to help you assess relative strengths and weaknesses in different subjects and systems of medicine.</p>
  <p>Rosh Review will always keep your account and self-assessment exam performance results confidential and will not provide such information to third parties without your consent. In the event that an educational institution (i.e., medical school or residency program) pays for the self-assessment subscription, the educational institution can request the performance results from Rosh Review through your written consent.</p>
  <p>The Rosh Review software has been tested with a wide range of computer configurations; however, due to the rapidly evolving computer industry and unpredictability of various factors affecting computer systems, Rosh Review does not guarantee the functionality of its software on every configuration, nor does Rosh Review guarantee predictable behavior of the software in general. You recognize all of the above terms and accept that use of the Rosh Review software on your system is done solely at your own risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">Access via Mobile Devices - Qbanks Only</p>
  <p>Access to Qbanks via certain mobile devices is provided as an additional feature, but it is not intended to be a replacement for computer access. Rosh Review, at its sole discretion, may choose to discontinue offering access via any or all mobile devices at any time with or without reason or explanation.</p>
  <p>In order to install and use any of our Qbank software or app(s), you must have a compatible device that meets all system requirements.</p>
  <p>"Jailbroken" or "Rooted" devices are not supported. (Jailbroken/Rooted devices refer to any devices that do not have original equipment manufacturers' (OEM's) operating systems and/or any devices that have operating systems that have been modified in a manner not approved or supported by the OEM). You agree that you will not attempt to install or use the software on any jailbroken device. Further, any attempt to install or use the software on a jailbroken/rooted device will constitute breach of these terms and conditions of use and may result in account termination, without refund, at the sole discretion of Rosh Review.</p>
  <p>You agree that Rosh Review will not be held liable for any damages to your devices, operating systems, and/or any data loss resulting from the direct or indirect installation or use of the provided software.</p>
  <p>No refunds or cancellation will be honored due to your inability to install and/or use the provided software on any mobile device (regardless of whether or not the device meets the minimum system requirements).</p>
  <p>An internet connection is required while the software is in use, and a Wi-Fi internet connection with an unlimited data plan is highly recommended (both unlimited upload and unlimited download). Use of a fixed data plan, limited data plan, and/or any other pay-per-use data plan for internet connection is not recommended. If you use a fixed, limited, or pay-per-use data plan, you will be solely responsible for any data charges incurred. You agree that Rosh Review will not be held liable for any data charges, overage fees, or any other miscellaneous fees or costs that result, directly or indirectly, from use of the software on your devices, including in the event of software malfunction.</p>
  <p>While a test is in progress, you agree that you will not attempt, in any way, to copy or capture the contents of any test screen (including, but not limited to, via any OEM-provided functionality or third-party applications). Rosh Review reserves the right to disable your account without refund in the event that you attempt and/or copies any Rosh Review copyrighted content.</p>
  <p>It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your mobile device is appropriately used and safeguarded. In the event that your device is lost or stolen, you must notify Rosh Review immediately so that we may disable access to the account. Any violations of these terms and conditions under your account will be treated as if you performed said actions, and you will be fully liable for any damages directly or indirectly resulting from said violations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">Export Restrictions on International Sales</p>
  <p>In accordance with current U.S. export restrictions, Rosh Review software may be downloaded by individuals throughout the world except those in the following embargoed countries: Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Myanmar (formerly Burma), and Sudan. If you are residing in one of these countries, you may not purchase a subscription or download Rosh Review software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">Order</p>
  <p>Most of the information collected in the registration process will be used to process orders. During the order process, you will have to provide financial information such as your credit/debit card number, expiration date, CVV2 code, payee name, and billing address. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. To properly process your credit/debit card information, we must share your personal and financial information with the merchant bank for authorization and approval. This process is protected by an enhanced security system. We do not share your personal and financial information with any third parties, except those specified in our Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>When you attempt a transaction on our website, the card processor verifies available funds by placing a hold, or pending charge, on the amount of the intended transaction against your card. The card processor then confirms the accuracy of your remaining information (e.g., your address, CVV2 Code, expiration date, etc.) before processing the transaction. If you enter an incorrect address or other associated detail, then the transaction is declined. This is NOT a situation unique with this website, but it is how virtually all online transactions are handled. Typically it takes the card issuing bank 2-5 days to clear associated pending charges resulting from failed/declined attempts.</p>
  <p>We charge for each successful transaction attempt and provide a confirmation of such on our website and send a confirmation email to the registered email address upon each successful transaction on our website. You can also log-in to your account on our website and click on "Payments" section to retrieve a copy of your payment receipt(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">Refunds</p>
  <p>Except as otherwise provided in this agreement or at the sole discretion of Rosh Review, no refunds, cancellations, or changes to subscriptions will be allowed.</p>
  <p>Rosh Review reserves the right to refuse a refund if the user is found to be in violation of Terms and Conditions or acting against Rosh Review's interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p class="bold">Subscription Term</p>
  <p>You have obtained the right to use and access the licensed materials for the course(s) you have subscribed to for the subscription period of that course(s).

The subscription will start immediately after the activation unless you notify Rosh Review with a desired start date before using any part of the subscription. Subscription(s) cannot be suspended temporarily or reactivated later. You must use the subscribed material within the subscription period, and no free extensions are offered for any unused period. Renewals are offered as a continuation to current subscription term. Renewals are not offered for later use after expiration of current subscription. You must renew the subscription prior to expiration and use it continuously. Renewals allow you to work for an extended period on the existing Qbank test information. The Qbank test information will not be reset (deleting test information) when you renew the same subscription unless the subscription meets the 180-day period for which one reset of test information is allowed. This agreement and your license to use the licensed materials will also terminate, at Rosh Review's sole discretion, if you fail to comply with any term or condition in this agreement.</p>
